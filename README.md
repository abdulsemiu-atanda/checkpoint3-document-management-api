# Document Management API

This application provides REST API enpoints for a document management system. It allows create, retrieve, update and delete actions to be carried out.
It also ensures that users are authorized.

## Development
This application was developed using [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org) with express for routing. Postgres was user for persisting data with [Sequelize](https://sequelizejs.org) as [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)

## Installation
- Ensure that you have NodeJs and Postgres installed on your machine
- Clone the repository `$ git clone https://github.com/andela-aatanda/checkpoint3-document-management-api.git`
- Change your directory `$ cd checkpoint3-document-management-api`
- Install dependencies `$ npm install`
- Create a `.env` file in your root directory as described in `.env.sample` file

## Testing
- Run seeders `$ NODE_ENV=test npm run seed`
- Run Test `$ NODE_ENV=test npm test`

## Usage
- Start the app with `$ npm start`
- Use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to consume available endpoints

**Users**:
A created user will have a role, either an admin or a regular user by default.
- A Regular User can: 
    - Create an account
    - Login
    - Create a document
    - Limit access to a document by specifying an access group `i.e. public, private or role`.
    - View public documents created by other users.
    - View documents created by his access group with access level set as `role`.
    - Edit his record.
    - Search a users public documents.
    - View `public` and `role` access level documents of other regular users.
    - Logout.
    - Delete his details.

- In addition to the general user functions, an admin user can:
    - View all users.
    - View all created documents.
    - Delete any user.
    - Update any user's record.
    - Create a new role.
    - View all created roles.
    - Search for any user.

**Documents**:
Documents are created to have various properties.
They include:
- Published date
- Title
- Content
- Access (`private, public or role`)

**Roles**:
Roles can also be created, the default roles are `admin` and `regular`

**Authentication**:
Users are authentcated and validated using JSON web token (JWT).
By generating a token on registration and login, API endpoints and documents are protected from unauthorised access.
Requests to protected routes are validated using the generated token.
